		<h1>Our Method for Test Preparation</h1>
	<section>
For students preparing for either the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, LSAT, or MCAT we provide a team of 2 or more tutors, each of them focusing on his or her field of specialty. We offer a variety of programs adapted to each student’s needs and ambitions. For each of these tests we offer our flagship 24 hour Comprehensive Preparation Course as well as 18 hour and 12 hour courses. For individuals taking tests requiring specialized knowledge such as the MCAT, or for individuals needing more in-depth study of any test, 30 and 36 hour courses are also available.
<p>
For the <em>SAT</em>, the Math section is taught by a Math specialist, while the Critical Reading, Writing multiple choice, and Essay sections are taught by an English specialist. The fundamental concepts complemented with actual questions seen on the SAT form the basis of our lessons. We help a student train under rigorous (i.e., “test-like”) conditions. 
<p>
For the <em>ACT</em>, the Math and Science Reasoning Sections are taught by a Science specialist, while the English, Essay, and Reading Sections are taught by an English specialist. While similar concepts apply to the ACT as the SAT, we analyze the sometimes subtle differences between the two high school achievement tests in order to maximize the returns on a student’s effort. 
<p>
<em>GRE</em> preparation is divided between a Quantitative specialist and a Verbal Reasoning specialist. The <em>MCAT</em> is taught by a high-scoring tutor (39/Q) along with an essay specialist.  The <em>LSAT</em> is taught by a Language specialist with an additional Logic specialist. The university level achievement tests, particularly the MCAT or LSAT, may require a longer period of study in order to fully maximize one’s score. A course schedule lasting for six months to a year would not be inappropriate.
